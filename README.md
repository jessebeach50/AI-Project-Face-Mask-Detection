# AI-Project-Face-Mask-Detection
This code was for our AI project.  It should work by detecting whether you are wearing a face mask or not. 
It will access your computer's camera and put a green box over your face if it detects a mask,
and a red box over your face if it does not.
You will need to train the model using the dataset linked here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KecJp2Wr6_nM5YM9w7MbO790i5WBKrAj?usp=sharing
